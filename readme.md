# Old-School Gamer Trivia

### Overview

Old-School Gamer Trivia is a simple, timed quiz in which the player guesses the correct answers to a series of gaming-related questions. The results of their answers are tallied and presented at the end of each game.


### A Few Things To Remember:

* The player has fifteen second to answer each question presented.

* There are ten questions total, each presented randomly. The answers are randomized for each game, as well.

* The player is presented with their total number of correct and incorrect answers at the end of the game, with an option to start over.

* Running out of time when answering a question counts as an incorrect answer.
